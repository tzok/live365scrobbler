1. Prerequisites
You need Python 2.x or Python 3.x with pyLast
(http://code.google.com/p/pylast/) library installed for either of them.

2. Configuration
The configuration file is located in:
$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/live365-scrobbler/configuration

NOTE: If XDG_CONFIG_HOME is unset, the default $HOME/.config will be used
instead.

The configuration file requires these four lines:
API_KEY = ...
API_SECRET = ...
USERNAME = ...
PASSWORD = ...

Your API key and secret can be obtained here:
http://www.lastfm.pl/api/account

Your username and password are your Last.fm's account data.

NOTE: Please chmod to 600 the configuration file, unless you want other users
to send prank scrobbles to Last.fm ;)

3. Usage
Just run from the command line:
./live365scrobbler.py <STATION_NAME>

Where STATION_NAME is the name in live365 online radio. For example, for
Death.FM radio, the STATION_NAME is jeric_dfm. You can find this by looking at
the station page i.e. in this example:
http://www.live365.com/stations/jeric_dfm

4. Additional notes:
The scrobbler sends both scrobbles and "Now listening" information. It ignores
the radio station adverts, hopefully always :)
